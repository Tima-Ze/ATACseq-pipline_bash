# ATACseq-pipeline_bash

This repository contains **bash scripts** for preprocessing ATAC-seq data starting from FASTQ files.

## Overview
The scripts automate common preprocessing steps for ATAC-seq analysis.  
All raw FASTQ files should be stored in the `data/fastq` directory before running the pipeline.

## Usage
To execute all preprocessing steps in one go, simply run:

```bash
bash pipeline.sh
